# Ratatouille
### A library for doctor4t's mods and supporter cosmetics

## Features
### Library
- Rendering utils derived from [Lodestone](https://modrinth.com/mod/lodestonelib) (by Sammy; and Lodestar)
- Cosmetics customisation util (made for my supporter cosmetics but can also be used out of the box for more general cosmetic mods who need simple customisation)
- Item custom hit sound and particle utils

### Supporter Cosmetics
- For Ko-Fi or YouTube members
    - Icon next to your name as well as colored name
    - Head plushies: Sneak-use any plush item while not aiming at a block to open the cosmetics screen

### Additional Goodies
- RAT Plushies (Rat Maid, Folly and Mauve)
    - Can be honked
    - Noteblocks can be placed on top to play the plush's honk sound as the instrument
